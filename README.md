## Installation
Download [the latest release](https://github.com/SychO9/flarum-profile-cover/releases) package and upload it to your forum's theme section.

## Updating
To update the theme, you can either manually apply the changes to the theme's files, or overwrite the theme files with files from a new release package.

### Overwriting files with new release package files
This means that any custom file edits you may have made to the theme or any mod's modifications to the theme files will be lost, the former is not a problem as long as you remember your custom edits. The latter can create big problems with your forum setup.

So the only way for you to update the theme this way, is for you to avoid installing mods that edit the theme's files and make sure the theme's files are untouched.

### Manually updating
If for whatever reason you cannot leave the theme files untouched, the only other way is for you to make the theme edits made from your version to the latest.

To list these edits, simply use the following URL by replacing the `VERSION` by your theme's version number and `NEW_VERSION` by the latest version number which you can see in [the releases page](https://github.com/SychO9/flarum-profile-cover/releases).
